1.  Create a bash command for interactive mode and passive mode in com.bat.

2.  printe() in print.c shows the error message. The function can't
    show where exactly the error is.

3.  Need to implement linked list to the process of lexical analysis
    (char **token, t_type *type, int *indent_token) for dynamic memory
    allocation in (token.c). After lexical analysis, Allocate some
    space with fixed allocation in global header file (data.h).

4.  Add a compilation program, which compiles the program into assembly
    program. Steps to do it.
    Step 1:    Understand the difference of working logic of compilation
               in each system.
    Step 2:    Write Algorithms for each system. Try to build common
               functions as much as possible.
    Step 3:    Write the common function which is used among every algorithm.
    Step 4:    Build the compiler for each system by using preprocessor
               directive.

5.  Add functions to edit prompt of syntax and parametres.
