1.  Need to implement linked list to the process of lexical analysis
    (char **token, t_type *type, int *indent_token) for dynamic memory
    allocation in (token.c). After lexical analysis, Allocate some
    space with fixed allocation in global header file (data.h).

2.  Change the program which writes the compiled program direct to
    the file while compilation. Now, the compiled program is saved
    on the string "pgm" and then write it to the new file and compile.

3.  Add a compilation program, which compiles the program into inline assembly 
    using preprocessor directive.
